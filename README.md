# Hierarchical Archiving System
## Overview
The system is a Python-based digital archiving solution developed for the Department of Engineering to transition from paper-based documentation to a fully digital environment. It provides a structured method for storing, retrieving, and managing departmental records, helping to reduce paper usage while improving accessibility and organization. The application is built with a graphical user interface to make file management tasks intuitive for users, and it integrates networking and database support to enable secure and scalable archiving operations.

## Technologies & Libraries
The system is implemented in Python and makes use of the following libraries and modules:

- **CustomTkinter**: for building a modern graphical user interface  
- **SQLite3**: for managing file records and metadata in a lightweight database  
- **Pillow (PIL)**: for handling and displaying image files within the application  
- **Sockets & Threading**: for enabling network communication and multi-user support  
- **Hashlib**: for file integrity verification using cryptographic hashing  
- **OS, Shutil, Datetime**: for file system operations and timestamp handling  
- **Custom File Manager (Thingy module)**: for organizing and managing archive files

## Project Status
This project was discontinued at an early stage following the departure of the project supervisor from the university. The existing implementation reflects the initial development efforts toward building the archiving system.
